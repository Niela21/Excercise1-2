Exercise for using GitHub 

## Problem and problem solving
One of the problems I faced in this project was ensuring the user provided input that is valid as they could provide input that is not integer and if it is, it might be an invalid move. I used a try-catch to solve the input problem and a check to make sure the move is valid
This might not be a complicated problem, but it taught me to think and plan ahead for any special cases

Steps I took:
Identify Task
Identify task restrictions
Identify special cases
Design a solution
Test
Implement
